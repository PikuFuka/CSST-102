# **Introduction to Machine Learning**
**What is Machine Learning?**

Machine learning is a specific type of artificial intelligence that allows systems to learn from data and detect patterns without much human intervention.
Machine learning algorithms have a variety of functions, like helping to filter email, identify objects in images and analyze large volumes of increasingly complex data sets.

**Types of Machine Learning**

There are several types of machine learning, each with special characteristics and applications. Some of the main types of machine learning algorithms are as follows:
* Supervised Machine Learning
  
* Unsupervised Machine Learning
  
* Semi-Supervised Machine Learning
  
* Reinforcement Learning
